
Company Valuation Project : Our team acted as a start-up data & analytics company and worked on a healthcare company data. We desinged and developed dashboards to give investors a view of the company so that they can gauge performance and manage their investment.In order to prepare for investor presentations, we developed a list of metrics to explain such as company valuation & performance by assessing product demand & supply,  profitability and month-over-month comparison. We also analyzed customer satifaction & landscpae using satisfaction score, referrals and Web Hits. Product Innovation was also one of the metric where we used innovation index  such as percent change in weighted average features per product, percent change in percent of sales in tangental market and percent change in percent sales not from the Top Product

250 Web hits per $100k
Web Traffic tends to be exponential due to referrals and linking 
Trend shows about 20k at $1m valuation but we expect closer to 30 - 35k web hits


2% Customer Satisfaction decline per $100k
Tends to level off
Also worth noting that although it may lower it’s actually for more customers so it evens itself out
Expect 70-75% satisfaction at $1m gross revenue
